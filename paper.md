# Summary
`qujax` is a pure JAX [@jax2018github], purely functional Python package for the classical
simulation of quantum circuits. A JAX implementation of quantum circuits inherits benefits
such as seamless automatic differentiation, support for GPUs/TPUs as well as integration with
a host of other tools within the JAX ecosystem.

`qujax` is hosted on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/qujax/) for easy installation and comes with detailed
[documentation](https://cqcl.github.io/qujax/api/) and a suite of
[example notebooks](https://github.com/CQCL/qujax/tree/main/examples).


`qujax` represents a quantum circuit as a collection of three equal length Python iterables: 

- a series of gate identifiers specifying the sequence of quantum gates to be applied to the qubits as part of the circuit. Each element can be either 
  - a string referring to a gate in `qujax.gates` e.g. `"Z"`, `"Rx"`
  - a JAX array representing a unitary matrix
  - a function that returns such an array
- a series indicating which qubits in the circuit each gate should be applied to 
- a series of indices indicating which entries of a parameter vector (which is provided 
when later evaluating the circuit) correspond to parameters of the gate (e.g. rotation gates such as `"Rx"` take one parameter).

For example, a valid quantum circuit specification would be the following
```python
qujax.print_circuit(["X", "Rz", "Rz", "CRz"],
                    [[0], [1], [0], [0, 1]],
                    [[], [0], [1], [1]])

# q0: -----X-----Rz[1]-----â—¯---
#                          |   
# q1: ---Rz[0]-----------CRz[1]
```

Note that for angular parameters, the default parameterised gates in `qujax.gates` assume 
**angles are specified in half-turns** (i.e. $\theta \in [0, 2)$) as opposed to radians.


### Statetensor

In quantum mechanics, a *pure state* is fully specified by a statevector
$$
|\psi\rangle = \sum_{i=1}^{2^N} \alpha_i |i\rangle \in \mathbb{C}^{2^N},
$$
where $N$ is the number 
of qubits and each $\alpha_i$ is a complex scalar number referred to as the $i$th *amplitude*. Quantum states are also normalised such that $\langle \psi | \psi \rangle = \sum_{i=1}^{2^N} |\alpha_i|^2 = 1$. We work in the computational basis, where 
$|i\rangle$ is represented as a vector of zeros with a one in the $i$th position (e.g. for $N=2$, $|2\rangle$ is represented as `[0 1 0 0]`). In `qujax`, we represent such vectors as a
*statetensor*, where a pure state is encoded in a tensor of complex numbers with 
shape `(2,) * N`. The statetensor representation is convenient for quantum arithmetic (such as 
applying gates, tracing out qubits and sampling bitstrings). For example, the amplitude corresponding to the bitstring `[0 1 0 0]` can be accessed with `statetensor[0, 1, 0, 0]`.
The statevector can always be obtained by calling `statevector = statetensor.flatten()`. 

One can use 
`qujax.get_params_to_statetensor_func` to generate a pure JAX function encoding a parameterised 
quantum state 
$$
|\psi_\theta \rangle = U_\theta |\phi\rangle,
$$
where $\theta$ is a parameter 
vector and $|\phi\rangle$ is an initial quantum state that can be provided via the optional argument `statetensor_in` (that defaults to $|0\rangle=$`[1 0 ... 0]`). 

### Unitarytensor
Alternatively, one can call `qujax.get_params_to_unitarytensor_func` to get a function returning a tensor representation of 
the unitary $U_\theta$ with shape `(2,) * 2 * N`.

### Densitytensor
The quantum states that can be represented as above are called pure quantum states. More general quantum states can be represented by using a *density matrix*. The density matrix representation of a pure quantum state $|\psi\rangle$ can be obtained via the outer product $\rho = |\psi \rangle \langle \psi| \in \mathbb{C}^{2^N \times 2^N}$. More 
generally a density matrix encodes a *mixed state* 
$$
\rho = \sum_{k} p_k|\psi_k \rangle \langle \psi_k|,
$$
which can be interpreted as classical statistical mixture of pure states, with
$p_k \in [0,1]$ and $\sum_{k} p_k =1$.

Density matrices are also supported in `qujax` in the form 
of *densitytensors* - complex tensors of shape `(2,) * 2 * N`. Similar to the statetensor 
simulator, parameterised evolution of a densitytensor can be implemented via general Kraus 
operations with `qujax.get_params_to_densitytensor_func`. Further details on density matrices and Kraus operators are available in the [documentation](https://cqcl.github.io/qujax/api/densitytensor.html) or published literature [@Nielsen2010, p.98-105]. 


### Expectation values
Expectation values can also be calculated conveniently with `qujax`. In simple cases, such as 
a combinatorial optimisation problems (e.g. MaxCut), this can be done by extracting measurement probabilities 
from the statetensor or densitytensor and calculating the expected value of a cost function directly. For 
more sophisticated bases, `qujax.get_statetensor_to_expectation_func` and \
`qujax.get_densitytensor_to_expectation_func` generate functions that map to the expected value 
of a given series of Hermitian tensors. Sampled expectation values (which replicate so-called shot noise for a given number of shots) are also supported in `qujax`.


# Statement of need

JAX is emerging as a state-of-the-art library for high-perfomance scientific computation in Python 
due to its composability, automatic differentiation and support for GPUs/TPUs, as well as adopting 
the NumPy [@numpy] API resulting in a low barrier to entry.

`qujax` is a lightweight, purely functional library written entirely in JAX, 
composing seamlessly with the ever-expanding JAX ecosystem, e.g. @deepmindjax, @blackjax, @mocat. 
It emphasises clarity and readability, making it easy to debug, reducing the barrier to entry, and 
decreasing the overhead when integrating with existing code or extending it to meet specific 
research needs.

These characteristics contrast with the already existing array of excellent quantum computation 
resources in Python, such as cirq [@cirq], pytket [@pytket], 
qiskit [@jax2018github], Qulacs [@qulacs], TensorFlow Quantum [@tensorflowquantum], 
DisCoPy [@discopy], Pennylane [@pennylane] or quimb [@quimb], the latter three supporting 
JAX as a backend. These represent complex full-fledged frameworks which supply their own 
abstractions, being either wider in scope or specializing in specific use-cases. The core 
difference is that `qujax` is designed to be purely functional.

While generic circuit simulation is within scope, `qujax` does not support
tensor network simulation. 
There is an active area of research investigating this as a tool for classical 
simulation of quantum circuits with software including DisCoPy [@discopy], quimb [@quimb] and 
TensorCircuit [@tensorcircuit]. While tensor networks represent a very promising field of research, 
their implementation entails a more sophisticated API (in tensor networks, the representation
of a quantum state can be considerably more elaborate), greatly increasing the complexity of the
package. Thus, tensor network computation is currently seen as being beyond the scope of `qujax`.


# `pytket-qujax`

`qujax` is accompanied by an extension package `pytket-qujax` supporting easy conversion to and 
from `pytket.Circuit` objects, thus providing a convenient bridge between pytket and JAX ecosystems.
It possible to use the other pytket extensions to convert from and to qiskit [@jax2018github],
Qulacs [@qulacs], cirq [@cirq] and Pennylane [@pennylane] as well.
